## Coding Quiz

This coding quiz geared toward coding bootcamp students enables the user to answer eight questions based on Javascript.

When the user begins the quiz, they will see a timer set to countdown from 75 seconds to zero seconds. The timer will start once the "Start" button is clicked.

At any moment, the user is able to click "View High Scores" to be taken to a page of their scores stored in localstorage.


After starting the quiz, the student will be taken through eight questions one-by-one which will display "Correct!" or "Wrong!" if the user answers correctly or incorrectly respectively. 


Once the user finishes answering all the questions or the countdown reaches 0, the quiz is over and the user is prompted to enter their initials to an input.  They can then click the "Submit" button to be taken to the high score page where their recent score will display along with their previous scores.  

They can then choose to either clear their list of scores from the local storage or to go back to the beginning of the quiz to retake it.
